The logic in the `getRadius()` method is calculating the smallest possible radius of a circle that can fully enclose a *
*square peg**. Let's break it down:

### **Understanding the Context**

- **`SquarePeg`** has a width (`getWidth()`).
- **`RoundPeg`** (the superclass) expects a `getRadius()` method.
- The adapter (`SquarePegAdapter`) is used to make a `SquarePeg` compatible with systems expecting a `RoundPeg`.

### **Mathematical Breakdown**

A **square peg** can be enclosed within a **circle** by considering its **circumcircle**—a circle that touches all four
corners of the square.

1. **Given:**
    - A square peg with width `w` (i.e., `peg.getWidth()`).

2. **Finding the Required Radius**
    - The diameter of the smallest enclosing circle is equal to the **diagonal** of the square.
    - The diagonal of a square is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

      \[
      \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{w^2 + w^2} = \sqrt{2w^2} = w\sqrt{2}
      \]

    - The **radius** (half of the diagonal) is:

      \[
      \frac{w\sqrt{2}}{2}
      \]

3. **Code Implementation**
   ```java
   result = (Math.sqrt(Math.pow((peg.getWidth() / 2), 2) * 2));
   ```
    - `peg.getWidth() / 2` gives **half the width** of the square (i.e., half of one side).
    - `Math.pow((peg.getWidth() / 2), 2)` squares this value.
    - Multiplying by `2` follows from the Pythagorean theorem (`a² + a² = 2a²`).
    - `Math.sqrt(...)` takes the square root, giving us the radius of the enclosing circle.

### **Final Formula in Code Form**

Effectively, the method implements:

\[
\frac{w\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

which is the radius of the smallest circle that fully encloses the square peg.

### **Purpose**

This allows a `SquarePeg` to be used in a system expecting a `RoundPeg`, ensuring compatibility by **adapting** its size
accordingly.
